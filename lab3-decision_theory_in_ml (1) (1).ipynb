    "Write your perspctive about Decision Theory. Could the given problem be solved using a different methodology? Explain your answer.\n",
    "Decision Theory is an important framework for making choices in uncertain situations, as it involves a careful evaluation of different options based on set criteria, individual preferences, and expected outcomes, aiming to maximize benefits or minimize risks. When selecting a smartphone, this approach helps assess various factors, such as cost, battery life, and camera capabilities. However, the problem can also be tackled using different methods. For instance, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) provides a structured way to handle conflicting criteria through techniques like the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) simplifies the decision by expressing criteria in monetary terms. Utility Theory emphasizes personal satisfaction derived from each option, while machine learning can offer insights based on past data to predict the best choice. Thus, although Decision Theory is effective, exploring these alternative methodologies can yield tailored solutions based on specific needs and preferences."
